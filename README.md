# sparkastML

This repository contains the machine learning components for the [sparkast](https://github.com/alikia2x/sparkast) project.

The primary goal of this lab is to enhance the search functionality of sparkast, enabling users to receive real-time answers as they type their queries.

## Intention Classification

The model located in the `/intention-classify` directory is designed to categorize user queries into predefined classes.

We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with an Energy-based Model for open-set recognition.

This model is optimized to be lightweight, ensuring it can run on a wide range of devices, including within the browser environment.
